<b> Drum Kit Web App </b>

Welcome to the Drum Kit Web App! This is a fun and interactive website where you can play drum sounds in two exciting ways. Whether you love clicking on things or pressing keys on your keyboard, this app is perfect for you!

<b> Project Overview </b>

My Drum Kit Web App is designed to make playing drums super easy and enjoyable. It’s like having your very own drum set right on your computer! This web app is created using three main building blocks of the web: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

<b>How It Works</b>

Here’s how you can make some awesome drum sounds:

- Click on the Instrument Icons: On the screen, you’ll see pictures of different drum parts like the bass drum, snare drum, and cymbals. When you click on any of these pictures, the corresponding drum sound will play. It’s that simple!

- Press Keyboard Keys: Each drum part also has a dedicated key on your keyboard. When you press that key, the same drum sound will play. For example, pressing the “A” key might play the bass drum sound, while pressing the “S” key might play the snare drum. This way, you can create your own rhythm without even touching the mouse!

<b> Technology Stack </b>

- HTML: This is the skeleton of our web app. It organizes all the elements on the page, like the drum pictures and buttons.
  
- CSS: This is the skin and clothes of our web app. It makes everything look pretty and stylish.
  
- JavaScript: This is the magic brain of our web app. It listens to your clicks and key presses and then plays the right drum sounds.
